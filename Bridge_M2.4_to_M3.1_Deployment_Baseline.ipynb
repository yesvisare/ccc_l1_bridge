    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "**What shifts:** You've completed Module 2 with an optimized, monitored, resilient RAG system running locally. But it's still on localhost:8000—inaccessible to real users. Module 3 bridges this gap by deploying your system to production with public HTTPS access, automated health checks, and one-command deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Without deployment, your production-ready code has no production impact. This baseline captures your current manual deployment process, recovery times, and risks so you can measure the improvement Module 3 delivers (80% faster deployments, 90% faster recovery, $350-550/month time savings).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "**New in this bridge:**\n",
    "- **Deployment baseline:** Documenting manual steps and time costs\n",
    "- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery):** Detection → Diagnosis → Fix → Verification\n",
    "- **Risk assessment:** Likelihood × Impact matrix for deployment failures\n",
    "- **Containerization preview:** Dockerfile and docker-compose concepts for M3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## After Completing\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have:\n",
    "- ✅ Documented your current deployment process in `deployment_process.json`\n",
    "- ✅ Measured your MTTR baseline (typically 30-120 minutes) in `mttr_baseline.json`\n",
    "- ✅ Identified your top 3 deployment risks in `deployment_risks.json`\n",
    "- ✅ Clear goals for Module 3 (one-command deploy, <5 min MTTR, public HTTPS)\n",
    "- ✅ Understanding of Docker containerization concepts for M3.1\n",

    "### The Deployment Vision:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current State (Post-M2):**\n",
    "- Optimized, monitored, resilient RAG system\n",
    "- Running on localhost:8000\n",
    "- 25+ minutes manual deployment\n",
    "- 60+ minute MTTR\n",
    "- High deployment risks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target State (Post-M3):**\n",
    "- Same system, but accessible to the world\n",
    "- Public HTTPS URL\n",
    "- One-command deployment\n",
    "- <5 minute MTTR with automated health checks\n",
    "- Deployment risks mitigated\n",

    "### 🎯 Core Module 3 Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **One-Command Deployment** (M3.1 Containerization)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Package RAG system into Docker containers\n",
    "- **Success metric:** `docker-compose up` starts entire stack (API + Chroma + Redis + Prometheus + Grafana)\n",
    "- **Learning curve:** 4-6 hours (Docker fundamentals)\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Adds deployment complexity, but provides portability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Public HTTPS Access** (M3.2 Cloud Deployment)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Deploy to Railway or Render with automatic SSL\n",
    "- **Success metric:** Public URL accessible from anywhere\n",
    "- **Cost:** $5-50/month for cloud hosting\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Monthly cost vs. 24/7 availability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Automated Health Checks & Restarts** (M3.2 Cloud Deployment)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Cloud platform automatically restarts containers on failure\n",
    "- **Success metric:** MTTR reduces from 60+ minutes to <5 minutes\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** 10-20% performance overhead for health check endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Environment-Based Configuration** (M3.1 + M3.2)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Separate dev/prod environments with secrets management\n",
    "- **Success metric:** No hardcoded credentials, .env files not committed to Git\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** More configuration complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Zero-Downtime Deployments** (M3.2 Cloud Deployment)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Update code without stopping service\n",
    "- **Success metric:** Rolling deployments with health checks\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Requires blue-green deployment or canary releases (added complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Foundation for Horizontal Scaling** (M3.4 Load Testing)\n",
    "- **Goal:** Validate system under load, prepare for multi-instance scaling\n",
    "- **Success metric:** Handle 100-1000 requests/sec, identify bottlenecks\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Scaling increases costs linearly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Expected Improvements (Post-M3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment Time:**\n",
    "- Before: 25 minutes manual\n",
    "- After: <5 minutes automated\n",
    "- Improvement: 80% time reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR):**\n",
    "- Before: 60 minutes\n",
    "- After: <5 minutes\n",
    "- Improvement: 90%+ MTTR reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Availability:**\n",
    "- Before: Limited to your laptop's uptime\n",
    "- After: 99%+ uptime with cloud hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Productivity:**\n",
    "- Before: 10-15 hours/month operational toil\n",
    "- After: 2-3 hours/month\n",
    "- Improvement: 75% time savings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Impact:**\n",
    "- New cost: $5-50/month cloud hosting\n",
    "- Time saved: 8-12 hours/month × $50/hour = $400-600/month\n",
    "- Net benefit: $350-550/month\n",
