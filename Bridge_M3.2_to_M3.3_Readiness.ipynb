    "## 🎯 Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "You just deployed your RAG application to Railway and Render with continuous deployment—but it's completely open to the internet. Before adding security in M3.3, this bridge validates that your deployment foundation is solid: URLs respond, auto-deploy works, domains are configured, and logs are visible. This checkpoint prevents building security on top of a broken deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform health validation:** Verify both Railway and Render deployments are live and accessible\n",
    "- **Continuous deployment verification:** Confirm Git push triggers automatic deployment\n",
    "- **SSL/domain readiness:** Check custom domain HTTPS configuration (optional)\n",
    "- **Logging access:** Ensure platform logs are visible for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ After Completing\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have:\n",
    "- ✓ Verified both deployment URLs return valid responses (or identified issues)\n",
    "- ✓ Confirmed continuous deployment works from Git push to live deployment\n",
    "- ✓ Documented custom domain status (done/pending/not configured)\n",
    "- ✓ Accessed platform logs and recorded recent entries\n",
    "- ✓ Understood the critical security gap and what M3.3 will address\n",

    "- You understand Railway's speed versus Render's documentation, free tier cold starts versus paid tier always-on behavior\n",

    "**✓ Built production-ready deployment pipeline**  \n",

    "- 10,000 bot queries = ₹3,000 before you notice\n",

    "- Store them hashed (never plaintext)\n",
    "- Require authentication on all endpoints\n",
