    "This bridge notebook verifies your API security implementation (M3.3) is production-ready before you stress-test performance capacity (M3.4). You've secured your API with authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and logging—but you don't yet know how much traffic it can handle. This checkpoint ensures your defenses work correctly before you push your system to the breaking point with load testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Moving to performance testing without verified security controls risks deploying a fast but vulnerable API. This bridge confirms your four security layers are active before you scale."

    "### ✓ Three-Tier Rate Limiting\n",
    "- **Per-minute limits:** 60 requests/minute baseline\n",
    "- **Per-hour limits:** Prevents sustained abuse\n",
    "- **Burst protection:** Allows legitimate traffic spikes\n",

    "- Protects against path traversal\n",
    "- Uses regex pattern matching\n",
    "- Stops 90-95% of common attack vectors\n",
