But all this work exists only on your local machine—no recruiter can see your containers, no hiring manager can test your API, and no portfolio reviewer can verify your cost analysis.\n\n**Why this matters:** Without a portfolio, your job search extends 60-90 days (opportunity cost: $15K-30K for mid-level roles). This bridge validates four critical prerequisites before you build your portfolio in M4.3: GitHub presence, project structure, cost documentation, and deployment experience.\n\n**The shift:** From local technical work → demonstrable, shareable portfolio assets.\n\n---\n\n## Concepts Covered\n\nThis notebook validates (does not teach) the following prerequisites:\n\n- **GitHub profile setup** (professional presence, bio, committed M4.2 work)\n- **Project structure standards** (README, .gitignore, requirements, clean folders)\n- **Cost documentation** (COST_ANALYSIS.md stub with TCO framework)\n- **Deployment verification** (at least one live URL from M3.2)\n- **M4.3 preparation** (checklist for README elements, demo assets, documentation quality)\n\nEach section runs a validation check and creates local status files you can update manually.\n\n---\n\n## After Completing\n\nYou will have verified:\n\n- ✓ GitHub account exists with professional profile and M4.2 code committed\n- ✓ All course projects (M1-M4) scanned for required structure elements\n- ✓ COST_ANALYSIS.md template created or existing file located\n- ✓ Deployment status recorded (URL provided or noted as pending)\n- ✓ M4.3 portfolio checklist reviewed (40+ items across 5 categories)\n\nOutputs: `github_ready.json`, `deployment_status.json`, optional `COST_ANALYSIS.md` stub\n\n---\n\n## Context in Track\n\n**Track:** Cloud & AI Engineering L1  \n**Bridge:** M4.2 (Beyond Pinecone Free Tier) → M4.3 (Portfolio Project Showcase)  \n**Type:** Validation checkpoint (non-graded, self-assessment)  \n**Time:** 15-20 minutes to run + variable time to fix issues\n\n---"
