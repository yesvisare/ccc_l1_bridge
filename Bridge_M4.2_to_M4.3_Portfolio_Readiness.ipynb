    "### Accomplishments from M4.2: Beyond Pinecone Free Tier\n",
    "\n",
    "You completed advanced infrastructure work:\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Evaluated three vector databases** (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) with real cost calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Set up self-hosted alternatives** including Weaviate with Docker and Qdrant locally\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Implemented hybrid search across multiple databases** comparing performance, cost, and operational complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Built vendor-neutral abstraction layer** demonstrating ability to switch vector databases without rewriting application code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Capabilities Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build vs. Buy Decision Making:** Evaluated managed services vs. self-hosted solutions\n",
    "- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Analyzed not just features, but operational complexity and maintenance costs\n",
    "- **Production-Grade Infrastructure:** Ran vector databases outside managed services\n",
    "- **Vendor Lock-in Avoidance:** Created abstraction layers for flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Portfolio Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** All this work exists only on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:** \n",
    "- No recruiter can see your Docker containers\n",
    "- No hiring manager can test your deployed API\n",
    "- No portfolio reviewer can appreciate your cost analysis without documented proof\n",
