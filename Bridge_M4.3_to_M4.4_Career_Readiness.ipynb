Honest Skills Assessment**\n- Exactly what this course taught you (and what it didn't)\n- Knowledge gaps for different role types\n- Additional skills needed for research ML, MLOps, AI engineering\n\n**2. Three Career Path Decision Cards**\n- **Framework Mastery Path:** Specialize in LangChain/LlamaIndex (RAG expert)\n- **RAG Specialization Path:** Deep dive on retrieval, evaluation, optimization\n- **Full-Stack AI Path:** Expand to complete ML product development\n- Each path includes: benefits, limitations, time/cost, decision criteria\n\n**3. Post-Course Mistake Prevention**\nFive common patterns that derail 60% of candidates:\n- Tutorial Hell (endless courses, no shipping)\n- Building in Private (zero visibility)\n- Perfectionism Paralysis (never \"good enough\")\n- Jumping to Advanced Topics (skipping fundamentals)\n- Learning in Isolation (no community)\n\n**4. Realistic Job Search Timeline**\nWeek-by-week breakdown:\n- Month 1: Portfolio polish, start networking\n- Month 2: OSS contributions, interview prep\n- Month 3-4: Active applications with refined pitch\n- Month 5-6: Multiple interview loops, offers\n\n**5. When Your Course Knowledge Isn't Enough**\nHonest discussion of roles where this course alone won't suffice:\n- Research ML roles\n- ML infrastructure\n- AI safety\n- Leadership positions\n\n**6. Continued Learning Resources**\nCurated, prioritized recommendations (not an overwhelming firehose):\n- Next courses by career path\n- Books and papers\n- Communities to join\n- Projects to build\n\n---\n\n### Your Next Step\n\nComplete this notebook's validation items, then move to M4.4 to get:\n- **A written 90-day action plan**\n- **Clarity on your next learning priorities**\n- **Realistic expectations for job search timeline**\n\n**This is the difference between \"I finished a course\" and \"I have a structured plan to land an AI engineering role.\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final Validation Checklist\n\nBefore advancing to M4.4, ensure you've completed:\n\n- [ ] Section 1: Portfolio inventory filled out\n- [ ] Section 2: `uptime_plan.json` created and configured\n- [ ] Section 3: `repro_check.md` timed dry-run completed\n- [ ] Section 4: Three-signal audit pass/fail tables completed\n- [ ] Section 5: `maintenance_plan.json` budget established\n- [ ] All failing signals fixed (if any)\n\n**When ready:** Proceed to **M4.4: Course Wrap-up & Next Steps**\n\n---",
